# CTF-IMT-FOR

We've noticed some weird activity on the port TCP/8888 coming from our new admin VM. Can you help us identify what's going on ?

Our brand new admin John Doe told us that he received an email about a resume. You'll find a copy of this email.

HINT:
1 - Identify the C&C address
2 - Trace the malware origin (bits n stego)

There's 3 flags to find in total.
